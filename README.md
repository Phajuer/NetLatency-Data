###dataset#1

** 688 time slices of RTTs between 99 nodes in the Seattle network**

This dataset consists of round trip times (RTTs) between 99 nodes in the Seattle network over 688 time slices. 


###dataset#2

** 18 time slices of RTTs between 490 nodes in the PlanetLab network**

This dataset consists of round trip times (RTTs) between 490 nodes in the PlanetLab network over 18 time slices.
